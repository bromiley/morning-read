# The Morning Read

Welcome to the Morning Read repository. The Morning Read is a daily post where I discuss and recommend a white paper, blog post, chapter of a book, or some sort of text I find useful for DFIR analysts.

The purpose of this repository is to source and preserve recommended readings, in case linked resources are moved in the future.
